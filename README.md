> **Project Status:** Active Research | **Role:** Project Lead & Researcher

##  Project Overview
This repository hosts the data analysis pipeline for my undergraduate research project titled **"The Analysis of AI Usage Habits Among University Students"**, supported by **TÜBİTAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Türkiye)** under the 2209-A program.

The project aims to quantify how Gen-Z students integrate Artificial Intelligence tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, Midjourney) into their academic workflows and to measure the correlation between **AI usage frequency** and **academic performance (GPA)**.

## Key Objectives
- **Data Collection:** Conducting a comprehensive survey among 500+ undergraduate students across different faculties.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Using Python (Pandas & SciPy) to test hypotheses regarding "AI dependency" and "Productivity".
- **Trend Forecasting:** Predicting future adoption rates based on current usage patterns.

##  Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Statistical Testing:** SciPy (Pearson Correlation, T-Tests)

##  Repository Structure
- `data_simulation.py`: A Python script that generates synthetic survey data to test the analysis pipeline before the field study is completed.
- `simulated_survey_data.csv`: Sample dataset representing expected student behaviors.
- `analysis_results.png`: Visual output of the correlation analysis.

##  Preliminary Findings (Simulation)
*Based on the initial pilot simulation:*
- A **positive correlation** was observed between "Controlled AI Usage" and "Research Efficiency".
- Students in **Engineering & Economics** faculties show a higher adoption rate (78%) compared to other disciplines.
